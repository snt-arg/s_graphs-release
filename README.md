# S-Graphs

**Situational graphs (S-Graphs)** is a ROS2 package for generating in real-time four-layered hierarchical factor graphs representing a scene graph including **_Keyframes_** registring the robot poses, **_Walls_** which maps wall planes, **_Rooms Layer_** constraining the wall planes using room/infinite_room factors, **_Floors_** constraining the rooms within a given floor level. It also supports several graph constraints, such as GPS, IMU acceleration (gravity vector), IMU orientation (magnetic sensor). We have tested this package with Velodyne (VLP16) sensors in structured indoor environments. This work is a fork of [hdl_graph_slam](https://github.com/koide3/hdl_graph_slam) which as previously in ROS1.

## Unit Tests for S-Graphs

Unit tests for some of the S-Graphs functions are in the folder tests. They can be executed using the following command

```bash
colcon test --packages-select s_graphs --event-handler=console_direct+
```

## Docker (NOTE: Docker still uses the ROS1 (older) version of S-Graphs)

A docker image is provided with s_graphs. This image is all set and is just pull and play. Follow the instructions below in order to use s_graphs via docker.

1. Pull the docker image from DockerHub

```bash
docker pull sntarg/s_graphs:latest
```

2. Create a container for the s_graphs image.

```bash
docker run -dit --net host --name s_graphs_container sntarg/s_graphs
```

This command also incorporates the flags `d`, which makes the container run in the detached mode and `net`, which gives the container the access of the host interfaces.

3. Execute the container

```bash
docker exec -ti s_graphs_container bash
```

4. Source the s_graphs worspace

```bash
source devel/setup.bash
```

**Note:** Once the worspace is sourced once, it will no longer be required to resourced it again.

### Running Datasets using docker

In order to run datasets using docker, one just needs to use the command `roslaunch s_graphs s_graphs.launch use_free_space_graph:=true env:=virtual 2>/dev/null` inside docker.
The other 2 commands should be executed outside docker. Additionally, the `env` parameter should be changed accordingly to the type of dataset.

## Instructions To Use S-Graphs

1. Define the transformation between your sensors (LIDAR, IMU, GPS) and base_link of your system using static_transform_publisher (see line #94, s_graphs.launch). All the sensor data will be transformed into the common `base_link` frame, and then fed to the SLAM algorithm. Note: `base_link` frame in virtual dataset is set to `base_footprint` and in real dataset is set to `body`

2. Remap the point cloud topic of **s_graphs_prefiltering_node** and **s_graphs_node**. Like:

```python
    remappings=[
            ("velodyne_points", "/rs_lidar/points"),
            ("imu/data", "/platform/imu/data"),
        ],
  ...
```

3. If you have an odometry source convert it to base ENU frame, then set the arg `compute_odom` to `false` in `s_graphs_ros2_launch.py` and then remap odom topic in **s_graphs_node** like

```python
     remappings=[
            ("velodyne_points", "/platform/velodyne_points"),
            ("/odom", "/husky/odometry"),
        ],
  ...
```

Note: If you want to visualize the tfs correctly then your odom source must provide a tf from the `odom` to `base_link` frame.
